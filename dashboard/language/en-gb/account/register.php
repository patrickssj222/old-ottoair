For each and every shipment, shipper represents, warrants, and certifies that all statements

criminal penalties may be imposed for making incorrect, false or fraudulent statements, or for
the violation of any laws or regulations on importation or exportation. Shipper is solely
responsible for determining any import or export license requirements and for obtaining any
export or import license or other official authorization.

If the shipment contains Dangerous Goods, as defined in these Terms, the shipper shall have
the sole obligation and responsibility to so state on the Ottoair’s website and to comply with all
IATA regulations for shipments of Dangerous Goods, and any and all applicable law. If required
by applicable regulations, the shipper shall also submit a signed Shipper’s Declaration for
Dangerous Goods and all other relevant documents for the shipment of Dangerous Goods.
If the commodity being shipped is not Dangerous Goods, but could be confused as such, the
shipper shall place the words “NOT RESTRICTED” on the ottoair’s website to indicate that the
shipper has reviewed the shipment against the appropriate regulations and determined that the
shipment does not qualify as Dangerous Goods, and otherwise complies with all applicable
regulations.

Dangerous Goods may not be included in the same shipment with non-regulated commodities.
Dangerous Goods and non-Dangerous Goods shall be declared on separate Ottoair’s website.

The shipper and consignee shall be liable, jointly and severally, for all charges payable on
account of any shipment, including, but not limited to, Transportation charges and all duties,

defend and hold UPS harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, fines, penalties,

suffered or disbursed for any violation of any of these Terms or any other default of the shipper,

not to obtain.

accordance with the laws of Canada.';
